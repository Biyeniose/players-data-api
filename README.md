# Football Players Data API with MongoDB based Documents

API endpoints allow you request data of specific players in the most popular leagues. 
Built on top of Node.js, Express and MongoDB Atlas, data is to be continously updated by scraping https://www.transfermarkt.com

Here is what a sample response for a player looks like:

```
